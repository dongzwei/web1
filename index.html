<h2>web</h2>
<p>I know that I, I can't believe
Just what the past has brought me
To the man I wanna be
I know that we have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we've changed but
Change can be so good
So let's not forget why
It's understood that

chorus:
Time, look where we are and what we've been through
Time, sharing our dreams
Time, goes on and on everyday, baby
Time is what it is
Come what may(come what may)

I remember when, mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
