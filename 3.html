<p>Where does this road lead? Where is it taking me? I’ll never know But I still kyou choose and create the path that you'd like to choose I’ll never know Still I keep walking Why am I standing on this road? Is this the road that I am destined to be Will my dream be achieved at the end of this path? What will really make me happy? Wealth? Money? Or the people I love? I want to know But I still cannot find the answer I want to choose this road with confidence And be sure that this is the path I want to walk Not look back with any regrets It’s the path I want But I’m still not sure which road it is
